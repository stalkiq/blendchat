## Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: How is this different from Slack?**
A: "Slack requires everyone to join. BlendChat meets people where they are - email. The AI layer adds value Slack doesn't have natively."

**Q: What's your defensible moat?**
A: "Three things: (1) Email integration creates lock-in, (2) AI insight engine improves with data, (3) Network effects - every invite brings new users."

**Q: Why will people pay?**
A: "Free users hit the 5-chat limit quickly. Pro users get unlimited chats + advanced AI (summaries, action items, integrations). Enterprise wants compliance and SSO."

**Q: What's your customer acquisition cost?**
A: "Viral growth through invites. Projected CAC under $5, LTV over $100. 20:1 ratio."

**Q: How do you compete with Microsoft?**
A: "Microsoft builds for enterprises. We build for collaboration across companies. Different customer, different use case."

**Q: What's your technical risk?**
A: "OpenAI dependency is the main one. We have fallback models (Claude, Llama) and are building proprietary insight models for common patterns."

**Q: Team?**
A: "Technical founder with AWS + AI expertise. Built v1 in days. Looking for co-founder with go-to-market experience."

**Q: Exit strategy?**
A: "Acquisition by Slack, Microsoft, or Google makes sense at $100M-$500M. IPO path possible if we hit $50M+ ARR."
