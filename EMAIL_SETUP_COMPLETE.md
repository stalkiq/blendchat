# âœ… Email Setup Complete!

Your BlendChat application is now fully configured to receive emails via AWS SES!

## What Was Done

### 1. Infrastructure Deployed âœ…
- **Lambda Function**: Created to process incoming emails
  - Function Name: `BlendChatEmailStack-EmailReceiverAFF8A1DC-VHL8xeWfzWFc`
  - Parses emails and adds them as messages to chats
  
- **SES Receipt Rule Set**: Created and activated
  - Rule Set Name: `blendchat-email-rules`
  - Catches all emails sent to `chat-*@chatbudi.com`
  - Status: **ACTIVE** âœ…

### 2. Domain Configuration âœ…
- **Domain Verified**: `chatbudi.com` is verified in SES
  - Verification Status: **Success** âœ…
  
- **DNS Records Added**:
  - TXT record for domain verification: `_amazonses.chatbudi.com`
  - MX record for email receiving: `10 inbound-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`

### 3. Environment Variables âœ…
- **LAMBDA_SECRET_KEY** added to Amplify: `EpdIZFQaCooPl5NtIQHrlPAWdod0w53w`
- Amplify app redeployed to apply changes

## How It Works

1. **Create a Chat**: When you create a new chat, a unique email address is generated (e.g., `chat-abc123@chatbudi.com`)

2. **Share the Email**: The chat email is displayed prominently in the chat interface with a copy button

3. **Send Emails**: Anyone can send an email to that address, and it will appear as a message in the chat

4. **Real-time Updates**: The Lambda function processes emails instantly and adds them to the chat via your Next.js API

## Test It Now!

1. Go to https://www.chatbudi.com (or your Amplify URL while deploying)
2. Create a new chat and note the generated email (e.g., `chat-xyz789@chatbudi.com`)
3. Send an email from any email client to that address
4. Watch it appear in your chat! ðŸŽ‰

## Email Pattern
- All emails matching `chat-*@chatbudi.com` are processed
- The chat ID is extracted from the email address
- Messages are added to the corresponding chat

## Architecture
```
Email Sent â†’ Amazon SES â†’ Lambda Function â†’ Next.js API â†’ In-Memory Chat Store
```

## Troubleshooting

If emails aren't appearing:
1. Check CloudWatch logs for the Lambda function
2. Verify the MX record is properly configured (`dig MX chatbudi.com`)
3. Ensure the chat hasn't expired (chats are stored in-memory and will be cleared on server restart)
