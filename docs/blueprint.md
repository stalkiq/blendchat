# **App Name**: Collective Chat

## Core Features:

- Shared Chat Interface: A real-time chat interface where multiple users can interact with an AI.
- AI Interaction: Integrate an LLM like GPT to respond to user queries within the shared chat environment.  The LLM is given the function of 'tool' which lets the LLM decide when, or if, to include some piece of information in its output.
- User Authentication: Secure user authentication to identify and manage different contributors.
- Contribution Tracking: Track each user's contributions to the chat for moderation and analytics purposes.
- Chat History: Store chat history so the conversation context is not lost, allowing for ongoing discussions and the ability to export chat data for training and analysis.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#BF5FFF), symbolizing collaborative power.
- Background color: Very light grayish purple (#F3E5F5).
- Accent color: Sky blue (#5FA8FF) to indicate AI responses and system notifications.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Simple, outlined icons for user actions and interface elements to ensure clarity.
- A clean, modern layout with clear separation between user input, AI responses, and chat history.
- Subtle animations for loading indicators and message transitions to maintain user engagement without distraction.
